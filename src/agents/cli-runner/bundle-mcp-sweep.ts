/**
 * Reclaims bundled MCP temp config dirs (`openclaw-cli-mcp-*`) orphaned by
 * gateway death. The per-run cleanup callback (bundle-mcp.ts) lives in gateway
 * memory: when the gateway process exits with runs in flight (restart, crash,
 * SIGKILL), the callback dies with it and the temp dir — including the rendered
 * `mcp.json` with the loopback URL and resolved tokens — leaks.
 *
 * Orphan detection is liveness-based, not age-based: live CLI subprocesses
 * carry the config path in their argv (`--mcp-config <dir>/mcp.json`, see
 * `injectClaudeMcpConfigArgs`), and live-session dirs can legitimately persist
 * across turns for days — removing a dir still referenced by a persistent CLI
 * child would regress the failure fixed in #73244.
 *
 * Argv liveness alone is not enough: the config is rendered at prepare time,
 * before the run enters the serialization queue, so a run waiting in the queue
 * owns a config that no process argv references yet. To tell such a live-owned
 * queued dir from a true orphan without deleting the former, the creating
 * gateway's identity (pid + boot-id prefix + process start time) is encoded in
 * the dir NAME by `mkdtemp`; an argv-unreferenced dir is removed only once its
 * owning gateway is provably gone (pid dead, host rebooted, or pid reused).
 *
 * Old-format (legacy) dirs without an encoded owner are NEVER auto-removed.
 * Their owner cannot be proven, so during a rolling upgrade a concurrently
 * running older gateway could hold an unspawned queued run whose legacy config
 * is aged and argv-unreferenced — deleting it would break that run. Legacy
 * dirs are therefore always kept and surfaced (a startup warn with a count) for
 * explicit operator cleanup: pre-upgrade leaked configs are reclaimed by
 * stopping the gateway and removing them by hand, not by this sweep. Once a
 * host runs an ownership-aware build every new dir is owner-encoded, so the
 * legacy set only ever shrinks.
 *
 * False positives in the liveness check (an unrelated process merely mentioning
 * the path in its argv) only KEEP a dir — the safe direction. Under Linux
 * `hidepid`, processes of the same uid as the gateway (which is what spawns the
 * CLI children) remain visible, so their configs stay protected; a scan that
 * yields nothing at all is treated as unknown and the sweep fails closed.
